# FLASK API with PostgreSQL

This template will get you started with a flask application using PostgreSQL and Marshmallow. It comes with a user account feature setup as well.

The user model, marshmallow schema, and login/signup/checksession routes have been created to get you started. (Adjust code to your projects needs)

### Start virtual environment

To check if you already have virtualenv installed:

```
virtualenv --version
```

putout: 20.31.2 or higher

If a version number was not displayed install virtualenv:

```
pip3 install virtualenv
```

Note: installation may very depending on the OS you're using.

To start the virtual environment:

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

To activate environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once the Environment has been set up you want to install the packages in requirement.txt file. Run:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To use flask session object for cookies, do the following:

1. Create a .env file in the root directory
2. Create an enviromental variable and set it equal to anything you want. You can also generate a key by running the following in the ubuntu terminal. Set the results to your variable.

```
python -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(16))'
```

3. In the following line add the variable name like so:

```
app.secret_key= os.getenv('YOUR ENVIROMENT VARIABLE NAME GOES HERE')
```

Assuming postgresql is installed and ready to use, to start working on the project:

1. Login and start postgresql server in your ubuntu terminal

Note: postgresql is a database server seperate from the flask application server. When starting the database locally, you can start it from any root in the ubuntu terminal. It doesn't need to be at the root of your project but that is okay too.

```
sudo service postgresql start
psql -U username -d database_name
```

Leave postgres terminal running...

Before following the instructions below be sure your postgresql database is running.

Now that your posgresql database is running, continue with these instructions [here](https://ruthr.hashnode.dev/api-template-with-flask-sqlalchemy-postgresql)

Feel free to raise an issue if you run into any problems!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
